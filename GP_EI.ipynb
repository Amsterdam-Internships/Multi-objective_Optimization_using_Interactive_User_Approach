To bring it into the form of value vectors, the dataset needs to be passed into a Multi-Objective Shortest Path Planning Solver which will output value vectors. These value vectors can then be an input for the GP. Thus, for now, I am using a synthetic Pareto Coverage Set (PCS) with 2 objectives and 20 datapoints which gives us synthetic value vectors for input to the GP."
